# portfolio
This is my portfolio site made for job applications etc. Made with HTML and CSS (incl. flexbox).

THE PROBLEM
The task was to build a portfolio, either by following Technigos design, or to make your own. I chose to follow the design and tried copying it as precise as I could, but chose my own images and color-scheme. The site should also be made with accessibility in mind, paying a little extra attention to that and also validating it. I also made the site responsive, with an extra breakpoint for desktop. 

It was a bit challenging to follow a ready made design, but a really good practise. A lot of time was spent checking pixels, margins and paddings, trying to get the design right. I used some span-tags to hide elements in mobile-size. As the design had quite a lot of different headings, one thing I would have done differently if I where to do it again would be to plan all headings from the beginning, the order of importance for example, to avoid having to make changes later on. Also going through both mobile and desktop design thoroughly in the beginning, to plan all the things that had to be done. Now I just started from the top and worked myself downwards. 

For the accessibility I used aria-tags on the links to Github, Stackoverlow and LinkedIn, as they only consisted of icons, no descriptive text. As for tabs, I assume that they shouldn't be used for elements that aren't links/buttons etc., as one instead uses the arrow-keys, but I found it hard to use a screen reader and not being able to tab the site, so I added tabindexes to headings, paragraphs and lists. 

The site is validated with W3 validation-tool and WAVE.
